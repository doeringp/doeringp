### Hi there 👋

My name is Peter.

In my job, as a .NET backend developer, I develop an identity and access management (IAM) system for my company's customer portals.
I strive every day to deliver world-class developer-friendly, well-documented and easy-to-use APIs, that make our developers happy.

- I ❤ C# and the .NET ecosystem
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a GraphQL layer over my team's micro services
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Functional Programming in C#
- 💬 Ask me about OpenID Connect and OAuth
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have shaken hands with the Bavarian Prime Minister without even knowing that it is him
